# MovieTicketBooking
It is a basic ticket booking system that is targeted for use in booking counters at the theatre. 

Concept of Simple Data Structures is used for the implementation. 
Language used : C++ 

Features : 
1) The application allows the user to view the current status of the seats in the theatre.
2) Allows the user to feed in the data to book the desired/available seat.
3) A unique ID is alloted to each ticket/seat.
4) Allows the user for Ticket cancellation provided the information of the ID is present.

Improvements : 

1) The system design is very rudimentary.
2) The data obtained from the system can be extended to automatic ticket printing machine; where the ticket holds a unique ID.
3) The system can be extended to Cloud to store the data, which can be helpful in analysing the data.
